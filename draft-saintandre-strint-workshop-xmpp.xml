    <section title="Introduction" anchor='intro'>
      <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) <xref target='RFC6120'/> (along with its precursor, the so-called "Jabber protocol") has been used since 1999 for instant messaging, presence, and other forms of near-real-time communication.</t>
      <t>XMPP has a distributed client-server architecture, with one hop from a client to a server and one hop between any two servers, for a total of at most three hops on the communication path from a given client to another client.  Although XMPP has supported per-hop channel encryption using Transport Layer Security (TLS) since 2004 through a STARTTLS upgrade mechanism on the standard XMPP ports (with a hardcoded TLS-only port for the client-to-server hop since 1999), in practice TLS has not been universally deployed for operational reasons.  In the last few months, operators of XMPP services have been working to deploy TLS more widely, and those efforts are summarized in this document.</t>
      <t>Given the client-server architecture of XMPP, per-hop encryption using TLS does not protect messages inside the application servers that are used for routing.  Therefore, various efforts have been made to provide end-to-end object encryption for the payloads of XMPP "stanzas".  To put it mildly, these efforts have been less than completely successful.  This document also summarizes the state of end-to-end encryption for XMPP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>Various security-related terms are to be understood in the sense defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discussion Venue" anchor="discuss">
      <t>The discussion venue for this document is the PERPASS mailing list, for which archives and subscription information can be found at <eref target='https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/perpass'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Per-Hop Encryption" anchor="perhop">
      <t>As mentioned, XMPP includes the ability to protect each hop in a communication path using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Although per-hop encryption does not protect XMPP payloads from attacks against XMPP servers (since absent end-to-end encryption the payloads would still be cleartext within the servers), it does protect against eavesdropping on the relevant XML streams.  Because eavesdropping on unprotected XML streams would reveal personally identifying information such as a user's contact list (which in XMPP is stored on the server) and the intended recipients of a user's messages, protecting all the hops in a communication path is critically important for maintaining the privacy and security of XMPP-based interactions.</t>
      <t>Until recently, client-to-server streams were widely protected on the XMPP network, but server-to-server streams were not. This state of affairs has had many causes:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>The lack of TLS protection was not as visible to end users or server administrators.</t>
          <t>Several major XMPP services did not offer or negotiate TLS over server-to-server streams.</t>
          <t>Deployment of proper certificates for authenticated encryption is operationally impossible in multi-tenanted environments.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The last item deserves some explanation. Many instant messaging clients "hardcode" the connection hosts for multi-tenanted domains. For example, if the XMPP service for example.com is serviced by hosting.example.net (and example.net is a large enough service provider), many IM clients will provide a "wizard" interface that enables the end user to choose "example.net" as a service type or provider when configuring an account. As a result, the client software will hide the security details of the connection to example.com and override identity mismatches of the kind otherwise forbidden by the security considerations of the core XMPP specification <xref target='RFC6120'/> and the "CertID" specification <xref target='RFC6125'/>.  However, because these overrides are not applied on server-to-server streams, many existing implementations and deployements do not even attempt TLS negotiation for server-to-server streams.</t>
      <t>Although a technology like DANE/DNSSEC (see <xref target='I-D.ietf-dane-srv'/>) or POSH/HTTPS (see <xref target='I-D.miller-posh'/> and <xref target='I-D.ietf-xmpp-dna'/>) would provide means to overcome the operational limitations of authenticated encryption, neither is yet widely deployed. Thus, in practice, when server-to-server streams are being protected often the technology used is unauthenticated encryption via TLS and the XMPP Server Dialback extension <xref target='XEP-0220'/>.</t>
      <t>In late 2013, a number of service operators in the XMPP community committed to mandating encryption on all hops under their control, and a number of software developers committed to supporting the features needed to make such encryption possible. The goal is to enable such encryption permanently on May 19, 2014. So far, one test day has been held (on January 4, 2014) and another test day will be held (on February 22, 2014) before the date of the STRINT workshop. The test day revealed bugs in several XMPP software implementations and prompted security improvements at a number of deployed services. Also helpful has been the "IM Observatory" site at xmpp.net, which enables end users and service administrators to test the security settings of any domain on the public XMPP network.</t>

<abstract><t>Experience has shown that it is extremely difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for TLS in multi-tenanted environments, since certification authorities will not issue certificates for hosted domains to hosting services, hosted domains do not want hosting services to hold their private keys, and hosting services wish to avoid liability for holding those keys.  As a result, domains hosted in multi-tenanted environments often deploy non-HTTP applications such as email and instant messaging using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain.  Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in obvious security implications.  This document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols.  The first method enables the TLS client associated with a user agent or peer application server to obtain the end-entity certificate of a hosted domain over secure HTTP as an alternative to standard PKIX techniques.  The second method enables a hosted domain to securely delegate a non-HTTP application to a hosting service using redirects provided by HTTPS itself or by a pointer in a file served over HTTPS at the hosted domain.  While this approach is developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association prooftype, it can be applied to any non-HTTP application protocol.</t></abstract>
